This was developed in SE450 Object-Oriented Software Development class at DePaul University. 
Code was developed over the course of the semester as new design patterns were learned. Although some of the code 
was already provided as a skeleton I did a large refactoring in the UI package to incorporate the use of Generics and a refactoring 
in the main package control classes to incorporate using enums in a state pattern implementation.
